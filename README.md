## Oh My Stars!

Welcome to our horoscope app, Oh My Stars! Github creators @Emi1yM, @mmevans, and @lFrederick2106 created this app to practice their newfound Javascript skills. This was created in a week while attending Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program. 

# What Skills Were Stretched in the Making of This App?

This app was made in week 9, after learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript. @Emi1yM also checked the app against many WCAG standards to make the app as accessible as possible.

# How Can I Open This App?

After cloning the project, change directories in your terminal until you are in the folder 'app'. Run 'rails server'. Then in a separate terminal, change directory into the folder, 'frontend'. Run 'open index.html' to use the app in your browser.
